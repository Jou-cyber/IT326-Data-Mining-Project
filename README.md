# IT326-Data-Mining-Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on applying data mining techniques, specifically classification and clustering, to a real-world healthcare dataset related to Alzheimer’s disease. The goal is to analyze patient data and identify patterns that can help in understanding factors associated with the disease and predicting diagnosis outcomes.
A related research paper on Alzheimer’s disease classification using machine learning is included in the Dataset folder.

## Project Motivation
Alzheimer’s disease is a critical health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Analyzing medical and lifestyle data can provide valuable insights into the risk factors and early indicators of the disease. This project aims to apply data mining methods learned in the course to gain practical experience and extract meaningful knowledge from real-world data.
